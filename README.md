Simple to the point of dumb this app could help you turn Windows 10 Mobile Hotspot ON on startup. This is something I needed but was not succesful finding an easy solution online.
Just add a link to app to your "shell:startup" with argument "ON"

Please let me know if this is been helpful to you.
Cheers!
